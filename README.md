## Random Deformation
The random deformation module applies smooth deformation fields to medical images and labels, ensuring realistic and anatomically plausible augmentations for deep learning training. A smooth deformation field **$$D(x)$$** is generated as the sum of local displacements across all labeled structures. For a labeled structure with mask **$$M(x)$$**, the displacement at voxel **x** is computed as:

$$
d(x) = w(x) \cdot \left[ S(x) \cdot (1 + r_s) + r_d \right],
$$

where **w(x)** is a distance-based weight defined as:

$$
w(x) = \exp\left(-\frac{\|x - c\|}{\lambda}\right),
$$

with **c** as the center of mass of the structure and **Œª** as a weighting decay factor. The term **$$S(x)$$** represents the relative position of voxel **x** to the center **c**, **$$r_s$$** is a random scaling factor, and **$$r_d$$** is a random displacement vector. The deformation field **$$D(x)$$** is smoothed using multi-scale Gaussian filters:

$$
D(x) = \text{Gaussian}(D(x), \sigma_1) + \text{Gaussian}(D(x), \sigma_2),
$$

where **$$œÉ_1$$** and **$$œÉ_2$$** are the coarse and fine smoothing scales, respectively. The final deformation is applied to the image or label using a displacement field transform:

$$
T(x) = x + D(x),
$$

with constraints to ensure the maximum displacement satisfies **$$\|D(x)\| \leq d_{\text{max}}$$**, preventing extreme deformations. The output is interpolated using linear methods for images and nearest-neighbor methods for labels, ensuring consistency in segmentation tasks. This method generates natural spatial variability while preserving anatomical integrity, making it suitable for tasks like medical image segmentation.
