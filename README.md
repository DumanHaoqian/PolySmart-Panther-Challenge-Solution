## Task1: Random Deformation Augmented ResEncUNet with Dice Loss only and 3 folds Ensambale(PC-task1-Final)
### Random Deformation

The random deformation module applies smooth deformation fields to medical images and labels, ensuring realistic and anatomically plausible augmentations for deep learning training. A smooth deformation field **D(x)** is generated using a combination of random displacements, Gaussian smoothing, and distance-based weighting. For each labeled structure, the displacement **d(x)** at a voxel **x** is calculated as:

**d(x) = w(x) * [S(x) * (1 + r_s) + r_d]**

where **w(x)** is a distance-based weight (e.g., **w(x) = exp(-||x - c|| / Œª)**, with **c** as the structure's center of mass), **S(x)** is the relative position of **x** to **c**, **r_s** is a random scaling factor, and **r_d** is a random global displacement. The resulting field is smoothed using multi-scale Gaussian filters to avoid abrupt changes. The deformation field is then applied to the image or label using a displacement field transform **T(x) = x + D(x)**. Key constraints include limiting the maximum displacement **||D(x)|| ‚â§ d_max** to prevent artifacts and ensuring the field is free of NaN or Inf values. The deformed output is interpolated using linear or nearest-neighbor methods (for images and labels, respectively) and saved in NIfTI format. This approach generates realistic spatial variability while preserving structural integrity, making it ideal for biomedical image segmentation tasks.
